# DAIN ncnn Vulkan

:exclamation: :exclamation: :exclamation: This software is in the early development stage, it may bite your cat

ncnn implementation of DAIN, Depth-Aware Video Frame Interpolation.

dain-ncnn-vulkan uses [ncnn project](https://github.com/Tencent/ncnn) as the universal neural network inference framework.

This work is developed based on our TPAMI work MEMC-Net, where we propose the adaptive warping layer. Please also consider referring to it.

## Usages

Input two frame images, output one interpolated frame image.

### Example Command

```shell
./dain-ncnn-vulkan -0 0.jpg -1 1.jpg -o 01.jpg
```

### TODO

* ~~interpolate rate control~~
* ~~port all custom layers to vulkan~~
* port pre-process and post-process to vulkan
* tiled process for reducing VRAM
* github action ci
* test-time sptial augmentation aka TTA-s
* test-time temporal augmentation aka TTA-t
* load images from directory
* read write webp
* good multi-gpu support
